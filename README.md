# ENS<sup>2</sup>:
**E**ffective and **E**fficient **N**eural **N**etworks for **S**pike Inference from Calcium **S**ignal
#
This repo provides the softawre package descried in this paper: [Effective and Efficient Neural Networks for Spike Inference from In Vivo Calcium Imaging](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.30.458217v2).

It includes:
- Pre-trained ENS<sup>2</sup> models for spike inference from calcium signal
- A demo showing how to use the ENS<sup>2</sup> system on sample data
- A tool to visualize the inference results from ENS<sup>2</sup>
- A demo reproducing the benchmark results in [our paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.30.458217v2)

Please refer to *Readme.doc* for detail instruction on usage.

The ground truth database for running benchmark and training models are described in [another paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-021-00895-5), and is obtainable from [the CASCADE repo](https://github.com/HelmchenLabSoftware/Cascade).
